# TouristGuide

A tourist Guide of Crete including access database 

--------------------------------------
* The application can be accessed by either visitors or registered users.  
 Registered users will have more features than visitors
 
* For Each user we keep a history (even temporary, as long as the program is used), that is to record as many parts of the tourist guide as he has already visited and to be distinguished from those who have not yet visited. The user also has the ability to clear its history

* In each form there is a menu of options 

* One of the available forms has a calendar that you should use (eg to read some events, or to post comments from users)

* We use a timer to implement (with a time delay) a sequence of photos (as a slideshow)

* Application users should be able to export to a text file the information available for a certain entry of the tourist guide, such as the details of a restaurant, or the details of a show.

* A part of the application information it is stored in a database (you can use DB Access, according to the lab that has been done).
